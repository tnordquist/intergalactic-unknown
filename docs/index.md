## Summary

I want to create an android application that serves as a game for its users, more specifically a choice based sci-fi survival game. The user will embark on an intergalactic journey where they must balance many variables. Some of these variables will be rational, like food or supplies, where others will be more subjective like relationship building or the lack thereof. My inspiration comes from a love of fiction and more specifically fantasy or science fiction not limited to just literature but also in media of all forms. 

## Intended users

I plan to diversify my intended user base in hopes I can reach a large market of users.

* Business professionals who enjoy games
    > As a busy professional who uses games to "disconnect" from work during breaks, I want to access all the features of a game easily and directly, so that I don't lose valuable time digging through multiple levels of user interface controls.
* Hardcore Gamer
    > As someone who games for the completion milestone, I use games to challenge myself mentally by dealing with arduous decision-making, I want my access to the content limited unless I work within the intended constraints of the games design.
* Science Fiction Fan
    > As a Science Fiction fan, I want access to quality Science Fiction material, so that I may occupy myself through abstract and creative world-building.


## Functionality
+ Phased based gameplay - during each phase the user will need to make a structured series of decisions every time. Each phase will start with a randomized resource loss that is visually prompted to the user, followed by asking them to confirm. The parameters of the resource loss possibilities is relative to what was defined in previous phases by the users decisioning.
+ Decisions made during each phase include but are not limited to: what resources to mine, charting next destination after assessing risk, allies to bring along / release, etc.
+ Resources include a powerful new energy supply which you can use or sell called Aether, perishables kit containing food and water, ship maintenance kits, runite (more to come on runite).
+ Materials include special items for example a religious relic, a powerful narcotic, antibiotics etc.    
+ Random events may occur which can alter practically anything within reason. Some examples include a black hole, visitations from a space cult, fuel leaks, allies becoming ill.
+ Thematic elements include a story about reaching a destination. 
+ Performance will be graded and measured, providing a leaderboard and encouraging replayability. 

## Persistent data

+ Game save data
    * Resources
    * Destination and future routes
    * Allies
    * Planets Traveled
+ Full functionality without internet access is preferred, but that will prove to be true or false in development.
    
## Device/external services

+ Photos will be accessible so the player can upload their image into the games profile picture as the "captains photo", the photo can also be listed on the game leaderboards. 

+ Contacts can be utilized to invite friends to play and eventually compare the scores amongst one another. I would like to make this device access optional to not discourage application use. 

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

Adding additional versions where for example unlimited random travel destinations spawn while the difficulties raise.
