## Summary

It is my goal to create an android application that serves as a game for its user, more specifically a choice based sci-fi survival game. The user will embark on a intergalactic journey where they must balance many variables. Some of these variables will be rational, like food or supplies, where others will be more subjective like relationship building or the lack thereof. My inspiration comes from a love of fiction and more specifically fantasy or science fiction not limited to just literature but also in media of all forms. 

## Intended users

Its my goal to make my intended user base versatile in hopes I can reach a large market of users. Some people play games as a disconnect from their professional work and may not be interested in a challenge. This user will be happy with the content alone without intense decisionmaking. Other users may use a game to stimulate themselves mentally and require a challenge to find value in what they are doing. 

> As a casual player, I want to access all the content of the game easily, so that I may decompress from my other projects.

> As a competitive player, I want my access to the content limited unless I work within the intended constraints of the games design, so that I may find value in my time spent.

## Functionality
+ Phased based gameplay - during each phase the user will need to make a structured series of decisions every time. 
+ Each phase will start with a resource loss. The parameters of the loss possibilities is relative to what was defined in previous phases. 
+ Random events may occur which can alter practically anything within reason. 
+ Thematic elements include a story about reaching a destination. 
+ Performance will be graded and measured, providing a leaderboard and encouraging replayability. 

## Persistent data

+ Game save data
+ Full functionality without internet access is preferred, but that will prove to be true or false in development.
    
## Device/external services

Photos will be accessible so the player can upload their image into the games profile picture as the "captains photo", the photo can also be listed on the game leaderboards. Contacts can be utilized to invite friends to play and eventually compare the scores amongst one another. I would like to make this device access optional to not discourage application use. 

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

Potentially adding real time animation between each "phase" to help create more depth in the "why" of the resource loss. The same concept could be used during random events, where an unwelcomed random event occurs and you can possibly avoid it based on a minigame.
