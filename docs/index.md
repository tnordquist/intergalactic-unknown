## Summary

It is my goal to create an android application that serves as a game for its user, more specifically a choice based sci-fi survival game. The user will embark on a intergalactic journey where they must balance many variables. Some of these variables will be rational, like food or supplies, where others will be more subjective like relationship building or the lack thereof. My inspiration comes from a love of fiction and more specifically fantasy or science fiction not limited to just literature but also in media of all forms. 

## Intended users

It's my goal to make my intended user base versatile in hopes I can reach a large market of users. 
One user "The Busy Business Professional" will play games as a disconnect from their work and may not
be interested in a challenge. This user will be happy with the content alone without intense decisionmaking.
Other users, whom I will call "The Gaming Hobbyist" will use this game to stimulate themselves mentally and require a challenge to find value in
what they are doing. Lastly, we have the "Sci-Fi Hobbyist", this person will share one of the two traits as the previous two individuals.
They will also naturally be fans of the Sci-Fi Genre. 

> As The Busy Business Professional, I want to access all the content of the game easily, so that I may decompress from my other projects.

> As The Gaming Hobbyist, I want my access to the content limited unless I work within the intended constraints of the games design, so that I may find value in my time spent.

> As The Sci-Fi Hobbyist, I want access to quality Science Fiction material, so that I may occupy myself through abstract creativity.


## Functionality
+ Phased based gameplay - during each phase the user will need to make a structured series of decisions every time. Each phase will start with a randomized resource loss that is visually prompted to the user, followed by asking them to confirm. The parameters of the resource loss possibilities is relative to what was defined in previous phases by the users decisioning.
+ Decisions made during each phase include but are not limited to: resources to purchase, charting next destination after assessing risk, allies to bring along / release, etc. 
+ Random events may occur which can alter practically anything within reason. 
+ Thematic elements include a story about reaching a destination. 
+ Performance will be graded and measured, providing a leaderboard and encouraging replayability. 

## Persistent data

+ Game save data
+ Full functionality without internet access is preferred, but that will prove to be true or false in development.
    
## Device/external services

Photos will be accessible so the player can upload their image into the games profile picture as the "captains photo", the photo can also be listed on the game leaderboards. Contacts can be utilized to invite friends to play and eventually compare the scores amongst one another. I would like to make this device access optional to not discourage application use. 

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

Adding additional versions where for example unlimited random travel destinations spawn while the difficulties raise.
